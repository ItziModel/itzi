## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If a developer don't know about a bug, he/she cannot fix it!
Therefore, it is very valuable to thoroughly describe the problem you encounter on the bug-tracker.

### Write documentation

Documentation is critical for all users, especially new ones.
But writing good documentation is time consuming.

The documentation of Itz誰 is hosted on [Readthedocs](https://itzi.readthedocs.io).
It is written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
and generated with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).
The source code of the documentation lies on its own git [repository](https://bitbucket.org/itzi-model/itzi_docs).

Please use one sentence per line and try to keep line length under 90 characters.
If above that threshold, break the line.


### Code

Please have a look at the [programer's manual](http://itzi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prog_manual.html).
