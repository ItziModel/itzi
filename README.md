**Effortless flood modeling with seamless GIS integration**

Itz√Ø is a powerful, open-source hydrologic and hydraulic modeling platform that makes flood simulation accessible to everyone.
Built with GRASS GIS integration at its core, Itz√Ø eliminates the complexity of traditional flood modeling workflows, allowing you to focus on what matters most: understanding and predicting water flow patterns.

## üöÄ Why Choose Itz√Ø?

**üéØ GIS-Native Design**
- **No data wrestling**: Work directly with your existing GIS data
- **Resolution flexibility**: Change model resolution with a single command, no matter the resolution of your input data
- **Seamless workflow**: From data preparation to results visualization, all within your familiar GIS environment

**‚ö° Advanced Capabilities**
- **2D surface flow modeling** with a damped partial inertia numerical scheme
- **Drainage inflow and overflow** with integrated SWMM coupling
- **Space-time variability of inputs**: Easily model rainfall fields from weather radar or satellite data üì°

**üîß User-Friendly**
- **Simple configuration**: Text-based parameter file
- **Flexible boundaries**: Easy setup of inflows, outflows, and boundary conditions
- **Rich outputs**: Generate animations, time series, and detailed flood maps

## üì¶ Quick Installation

### Prerequisites
Itz√Ø requires [GRASS GIS 8.4 or above](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/). Install GRASS first, then proceed with Itz√Ø installation.

### Recommended Installation (using uv)
We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for the best installation experience:

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install Itz√Ø
uv tool install itzi

# Verify installation
itzi version
itzi run -h
```

### Alternative Installation Methods
```bash
# Using pip
pip install itzi

# Using pipx
pipx install itzi
```

### Updating
```bash
# Update to latest version
uv tool update itzi
```

## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Prepare your data** in GRASS (DEM, rainfall, friction data)
2. **Create a parameter file** defining your simulation setup
3. **Run the simulation**: `itzi run your_config.ini`
4. **Visualize and analyze results** using GRASS tools, or export for external analysis
